Ans 1- I had learned some new things about the C language in this starting week such as how to print the 
output of characters and special characters by using printf command and "\" infront of special characters.
Second,the use of tab command(\t) that is used to shift some spaces in the output of code without using 
the spacebar key in writing the input of the code.Lastly, is the use "\n" which is used to shift the output
to the next line or this can also be used to leave one line and this helps me in writing a simple C program.

Ans 2- SSH means the Secured Shell Protocol it is used to create a secured environment from a remote server
where the data is shared by the users and is not accessible to everyone.Like,we have used puTTY to submit
the assignments to our respectable professors and those assignments are only accessible to our professor 
and will remain on the server only.

Ans 3- SFTP again is a type of protocol used to transfer the files securely.We are using winSCP for transferring
our ".c" file to puTTY which is a secured remote server and from there we share our work with our professors
