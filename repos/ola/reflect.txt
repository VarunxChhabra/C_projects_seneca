Ans 1 - I found this equation to be most difficult in this code, 
(number_of_daily_serving >= 1) && (number_of_daily_serving <= 4) && (bag_size_for_coffee_1 >= 0) && (bag_size_for_coffee_1 <= 250)
because I was applying or (||) logic in this code however I was not getting my desired output and then I realized that it should be the and (&&)
function then I apply this and able understand the correct logic as well as I got the correct answers.

Ans 2 - by "deMorgan's Law"
(coffee_1_type == 'L') || (coffee_1_type =='l');

Without "deMorgan's Law"
coffee_1_type == ('L' || 'l');

by if-else   
if (coffee_1_type == 'L' || coffee_1_type == 'l') 
	{
		printf("1");
	}
	else
	{
		printf("0");
	} 

Ans 3 - If we add a variable in the code it will consume more space and makes the code slow as the compiler took more time to read new variables
and its user value inputs. In part -2 of this workshop there are 20 variables, to make this code run smoothly and efficiently we didn't create another
variable in part -2 but in part -1 there are restricted and fewer variables available so it doesn't affect the code if we created it. Moreover, a code will 
look like a mess if we use extra variables for simple in-line calculations.
